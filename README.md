# Adjustable To Do/buy/acheive list

A basic React web-app built for learning purposes.


## Description

The React app is designed to keep track of the tasks, purchases, and achievements you need to complete. It offers a variety of input options to make it easy for you to add items to your lists and to manage those items throughout the completion process. 


## Intended Behavior

* Add items: The general input fields allow you to add custom text and a number value (e.g. required time or money investment).
* Click: Click the items when they are finished
* Clear button: The clear button allows you to remove all items from your list if you want to start from scratch.
* Delete button: The delete button allows you to remove individual items from your list if you've completed them or if you no longer need them on your list.

## Things I learned

* Difference between onSubmit; onChange; onClick.
* Working with extracting infromation from various input types in react.
* Pass a key prop to list item React components so they may be uniquely identified.
* Javascript Array methods like map and filter are not things I have used much before.
